Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and
of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the
use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or conversations?"

As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she
was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow
fallen into the sea, "and in that case I can go back by railway," she said to
herself. Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the
general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a
number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with
wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.
However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept
when she was nine feet high.

"You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question," added
the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt

"Curiouser and curiouser!" cried Alice, she was so much surprised, that for the
moment she quite forgot how to speak good English; "now I'm opening out like
the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!" for when she looked down
at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far
off. "Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great
deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you
can; but I must be kind to them," thought Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk
the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every
Christmas."

"You may not have lived much under the sea," "I haven't," said Alice, "and

have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!"

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder how many miles
I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud. "I must be getting somewhere near
the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I
think," for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for
showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was
good practice to say it over, "yes, that's about the right distance, but then I
wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?" Alice had no idea what Latitude
was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.

"What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of
sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter "Ah, my

tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little snappishly. "You're enough to try
the patience of an oyster!"

"How queer it seems," Alice said to herself, "to be going messages for a
rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!" And she began
fancying the sort of thing that would happen: "'Miss Alice! Come here directly,
and get ready for your walk!' 'Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see
that the mouse doesn't get out.' Only I don't think," Alice went on, "that
they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like
that!"

First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, "the exact shape
doesn't matter," it said, and then all the party were placed along the course,
here and there. There was no "One, two, three, and away," but they began
running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy
to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an
hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out "The race is
over!" and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, "But who has won?"

You tell them one or two items of news, and give them your views and opinions
on the Irish question; but this does not appear to interest them. All they
remark on any subject is, "Oh!" "Is it?" "Did he?" "Yes," and "You don't say
so!" And, after ten minutes of such style of conversation, you edge up to the
door, and slip out, and are surprised to find that the door immediately closes
behind you, and shuts itself, without your having touched it.
